Here's the final professional codebase tailored for deployment on Hostinger, including backend and frontend files, and with proper configurations.

The code is ready for deployment on Hostinger. To finalize:

Environment Variables:
Set up the following in a .env file:
PORT=3000
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
WEBRTC_URL=ws://your-antmedia-server-url
Frontend:
Build your React frontend with npm run build and place it in the public folder.
Deployment:
Upload this code to Hostinger's Node.js hosting.
Configure the hosting environment variables through the Hostinger dashboard.
Ensure your WebRTC server (WEBRTC_URL) is active and reachable.



nsuring your WebRTC server (WEBRTC_URL) is active and reachable means that the WebRTC signaling and media server you’re using must be properly set up, running, and accessible over the internet. This is crucial for enabling real-time peer-to-peer communication for video and audio streaming.

What Is a WebRTC Server?
A WebRTC server facilitates peer-to-peer connections by handling signaling, NAT traversal, and media relay when direct peer connections are not possible. It usually involves:

Signaling Server: Handles the initial exchange of information (like offer/answer) between peers to establish the connection. This is often built using WebSockets.
STUN/TURN Servers:
STUN: Helps peers discover their public IP addresses to establish direct connections.
TURN: Relays media streams when peers cannot connect directly due to restrictive network configurations.
Steps to Ensure the WebRTC Server Is Active and Reachable
Install a WebRTC Signaling Server:
Use an established WebRTC server such as Ant Media Server, Kurento, or a custom WebSocket-based signaling server.
Start the Server:
Ensure the server is running on the correct host and port.
For example, if using Ant Media Server:
./start.sh
Expose the Server to the Internet:
The WebRTC server must be accessible from your Hostinger-hosted app and the clients. Use:
Public IP Address: If hosting on a VPS or cloud provider.
Domain Name: Set up a DNS record pointing to your server.
Ensure the port for WebSocket (e.g., 5080) and media relay (e.g., 3478 for STUN/TURN) are open in your firewall.
Secure the Server:
Use HTTPS and WSS (Secure WebSocket) for production.
Install SSL certificates for your WebRTC server (e.g., Let’s Encrypt).
Test Connectivity:
Verify the WebRTC server is accessible by trying the WebSocket URL (e.g., wss://yourdomain.com:5080) in your application.
Configure Your Application:
Update the WEBRTC_URL in the .env file of your application to point to the signaling server:
WEBRTC_URL=wss://yourdomain.com:5080
Monitor the Server:
Use tools like server logs or a monitoring solution to ensure it remains functional under load.
Common Issues
Firewall Restrictions: Ensure your firewall allows traffic on the required ports (e.g., 5080 for WebSocket, 3478 for STUN/TURN).
HTTPS Requirements: Browsers require WebRTC connections to run over secure protocols (HTTPS and WSS).
Network Address Translation (NAT): Use a TURN server if peers are behind restrictive NATs or firewalls.
By following these steps, your WebRTC server will be ready to handle peer-to-peer video and audio connections effectively. Let me know if you need guidance on setting up or testing a specific WebRTC server!













// Final Codebase for Deployment

// Import Dependencies
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');
const multer = require('multer');
const Stripe = require('stripe');
const WebRTCAdaptor = require('@antmedia/webrtc_adaptor');
require('dotenv').config();

// Initialize Express App and Server
const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server);

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Multer Setup for File Uploads
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: 'uploads/',
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, `${Date.now()}-${file.originalname}`);
  },
});
const upload = multer({ storage });

// Stripe Setup
const stripe = Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

// WebRTC Configuration
const rtcAdaptor = new WebRTCAdaptor({
  websocket_url: process.env.WEBRTC_URL,
  mediaConstraints: { video: true, audio: true },
  peerconnection_config: {
    iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }],
  },
});

// Peer-to-Peer Video Rooms
const rooms = {};

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('User connected:', socket.id);

  socket.on('join-room', (roomId, userId) => {
    console.log(`User ${userId} joined room ${roomId}`);
    if (!rooms[roomId]) rooms[roomId] = [];
    rooms[roomId].push(userId);
    socket.join(roomId);
    socket.to(roomId).emit('user-connected', userId);

    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
      console.log(`User ${userId} disconnected from room ${roomId}`);
      rooms[roomId] = rooms[roomId].filter((id) => id !== userId);
      socket.to(roomId).emit('user-disconnected', userId);
    });
  });
});

// Admin Video Upload Endpoint
app.post('/upload', upload.single('video'), (req, res) => {
  if (!req.file) return res.status(400).json({ error: 'No file uploaded' });
  res.status(200).json({
    message: 'Video uploaded successfully',
    path: `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}/uploads/${req.file.filename}`,
  });
});

// Stripe Payment Endpoints
app.post('/donate', async (req, res) => {
  const { amount, currency } = req.body;
  try {
    const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
      amount,
      currency,
      payment_method_types: ['card'],
    });
    res.status(200).json({ clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});

app.post('/subscribe', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, plan } = req.body;
  try {
    const customer = await stripe.customers.create({ email });
    const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
      customer: customer.id,
      items: [{ price: plan }],
    });
    res.status(200).json({ subscription });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});

// Start the Server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});

// Frontend Integration (React)
// Ensure React frontend is built and served from the public directory.
